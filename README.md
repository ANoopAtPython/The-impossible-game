This is the impossible game.
The boss is 10e9 , or 1 billion (I think so) and you can do at most 4 damage each second and there is 2 boss
The boss is shooting spreadshot
Whats more , asteroid flow from every place (top , bottom , left , right)
You won't probably win unless you have a very * 10 time


There are 2 modes:

    Easy: You have the ability to do spreadshot and each bullet worth 2 damage
          Difficulty: 10 / 10 

          
    .Hard: You only firee straight bullet doing 1 damage
          Difficulty: 10e18 / 10 (harder than tidal wave)
